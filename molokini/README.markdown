renoise-molokini
================

Created by [thefifthcircuit](mailto:roger@thefifthcircuit.com)

This is a theme for the music application Renoise. It is based off of my
vim-molokini theme, which is itself based off of the various editor themes for
Vim and TextMate, including Molokai and Monokai. It is also based off of the
"Breed (beatslaughter)" theme and the "Molokai" theme for Renoise.
